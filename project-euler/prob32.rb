  We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of 
  all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 
  15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

  The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39  186 = 7254, containing 
  multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

  Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity 
  can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

  HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only 
  include it once in your sum.
