# Introductory Statistics Exercise Solutions

This folder contains a subset of the solutions to exercises from the [Introductory
Statistcs](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/) book, implemented in Python.

## Motivation

Although the book provides answers for most of the exercises, there is still value in working
through the solutions and even figuring out how to do the calculations in Python and in exploring
various Python packages related to statistics.
