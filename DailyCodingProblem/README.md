# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

My solutions to the [Daily Coding Prolems](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).

The focus of these is not to always get the correct answer but instead to explore different ways to solve them and to try to solve them using different programming languages. Depending on the problem, some programming languages have features that make the solution easier and others lack features and so the solution is a little more difficult. Beyond using these to sharpen algorithmic coding skills it also helps to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the languages.
